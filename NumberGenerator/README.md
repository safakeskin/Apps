I have created this program for my printer. My printer does not print both sides and I need to specify each number according some restrictions. It is so disgusting, so I creating this program that generates true numbers for me when I give inputs as:

    beginpage
    endpage
    pagespersheet

That program will generate 2 list of number, I will copy 1st list and print these pages, then I will copy other list and print this pages at back sides of the same sheets. I am pretty sure it will be ordered :))

Also, I like Haskell :))

comiple using ghc compiler with the command below:

```
ghc -dynamic -o main.out -outputdir intermediate PageNumbersGenerator.hs
```
