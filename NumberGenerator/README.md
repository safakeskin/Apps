I have created this program for my printer. My printer does not print both sides and I need to specify each number according some restrictions. It is so disgusting, so I creating this program that generates true numbers for me when I give inputs as:

	beginpage
	endpage
	pagespersheet

That program will generate 2 list of number, I will copy 1st list and print these pages, then I will copy other list and print this pages at back sides of the same sheets. I am pretty sure it will be ordered :))

Also, I like Haskell :))

comiple using ghc compiler with the command below: 
ghc -o <Program Name> PageNumbersGenerator.hs
